# 💻 Virtualization & Cloud Security Lab


This project contains a full set of virtualization lab exercises focused on Golden Master VM creation, private cloud infrastructure, secure authentication using Active Directory, and vCenter management using VMware technologies.

---

## 📚 Lab Topics Covered

### 🔹 Lab 1.1 – Golden Master VM Lab
- ✅ Created a base VM using Kali Linux in VMware Workstation
- ✅ Exported the base VM as OVF/OVA to serve as a Golden Master Image (GMI)
- ✅ Cloned and deployed multiple VMs from the GMI
- ✅ Verified NAT networking and internet connectivity on all deployed VMs

### 🔹 Lab 1.2 – Private Cloud Infrastructure
- ✅ Configured NTP and added ESXi hosts to an Active Directory domain
- ✅ Installed and configured vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA)
- ✅ Enabled SSO authentication using Active Directory as an identity source
- ✅ Created a new datacenter and added ESXi hosts for centralized management
